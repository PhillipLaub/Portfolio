      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/headshot.png" class="auth-image" alt="Phil Laub Headshot">

      <p>I am a web developer. I design, code, and modify websites. This includes layout that is not only visually appealing, but also creating a function driven page that is user-friendly, and has high functionality. </p>

      <p>Growing up in Southern California, I began my career in the consumer electronics industry, always interested in how things work behind the scenes. I spent twelve years managing and running electronic stores, and working with major cell phone providers. Over my many years of experience, I would often see problems in software and applications that I always though could be improved, and make life easier. </p>
      <p>I quickly became interested in diving into the world of web development, and learning how progamming works. I am constantly looking for ways that I could make a footprint in this technologically driven world, and bring some happiness to others in the process. I couldn't be more fortunate to work in an industry that I am passionate about.</p>
