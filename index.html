      <p>My name is Phil Laub. I grew up right here in Southern California, and spent most of my life in
        between Hemet and San Diego. I have a Wife and a five year old daughter, who I spend every
        waking moment with that I am able. I grew up as a musician, which led me to have such a love
        for different kinds of music. From Classic Rock to Hip Hop, just please don't subject me to
        listening to any country music. Some of my favorites include: <em>The Gorillaz, Wu-Tang, The
          Offspring, Eminem, Green Day, Led Zeppelin</em>, and many more.
        <br>
        I am also an enormous nerd, I love the Marvel franchise, however, I am much more of a DC
        fan (hopefully they can stop making such a mess of their movies one of these days). I am a
        big gamer, grew up with era of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>,
        nowadays I mostly
        play first person shooters with my friends whenever I get the chance. I spent more than a
        decade managing electronic stores, and I am extremely enthusiastic to be stepping forward
        into a career that is challenging and also provides the opportunity to create. I want to use
        what I learn to solve problems, make life easier and more convenient, and create something
        that can bring some joy into someones life.
